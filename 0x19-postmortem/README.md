Root cause and resolution

At 04:00 AM we tried to update our WordPress theme & plugins to the latest version. 
But the newly released update of themes & plugins for our website has some compatibility issue
s with the PHP Version of our hosting company & the version of the theme & Plugin developer company

At 04:00 AM after we try to update the Theme & Plugins. After updating the theme & plugins we tried the website.
 Is it working fine or not? After that, we found out it is not wor
king as expected. Then we tried to fix the issue and finally end up restoring the website to the previous version.
